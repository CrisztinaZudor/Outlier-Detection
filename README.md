# Outlier-Detection

Outlier detection is essential for identifying anomalies in datasets, ensuring data quality, and enabling actionable insights. <br>
This project evaluates three key methods: Empirical Covariance, Robust Covariance (MCD), and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), using the Wine dataset.<br>
<br>
Ouliers can be defined as:<br>
* Observations that deviate significantly from the expected patterns or distributions within a dataset<br>
* Noise points lying outside a set of defined clusters<br>
* Surprising veridical data<br>
